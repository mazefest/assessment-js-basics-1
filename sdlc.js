// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "This is where you will define the end goal of the software, and what is needed to meet that expectation"
const design = "here is where you decied on a design that will enable you to meet the goal you outlined in the previous step"
const implementation = "You are now actually coding the requirements you you listed earier"
const testingAngIntegration = "Test the software to make sure it meets the goal you set forth, and covering any edge cases. Then begin preparing it to run in real world scenarios, and finally releasing it."
const maintain = "In this phase you will make further improvements or adjustments to continue progress, or maintain stability on the original goal"
